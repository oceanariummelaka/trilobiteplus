<p><h2>Trilobite Fact</h2>
<br> Trilobites were present on Earth for more than 300 million years. This shows just how successful they were at adapting and evolving.  
<br> In comparison, our ancestors have been around for only six million years, with modern humans only appearing about 200,000 years ago. 
<br> That means that trilobites were around for more than 50,000 times longer than modern humans have been on the planet! </p>
